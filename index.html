<!--
  Body element is used by impress.js to set some useful class names, that will allow you to detect
  the support and state of the presentation in CSS or other scripts.
  
  First very useful class name is `impress-not-supported`. This class means, that browser doesn't
  support features required by impress.js, so you should apply some fallback styles in your CSS.
  It's not necessary to add it manually on this element. If the script detects that browser is not
  good enough it will add this class, but keeping it in HTML means that users without JavaScript
  will also get fallback styles.
  
  When impress.js script detects that browser supports all required features, this class name will
  be removed.
  
  The class name on body element also depends on currently active presentation step. More details about
  it can be found later, when `hint` element is being described.
-->
<body class="impress-not-supported" id="body">

  <!--
    For example this fallback message is only visible when there is `impress-not-supported` class on body.
  -->
  <div class="fallback-message">
    <p>Your browser <b>doesn't support the features required</b> by impress.js, so you are presented with a simplified version of this presentation.</p>
    <p>For the best experience please use the latest <b>Chrome</b>, <b>Safari</b> or <b>Firefox</b> browser.</p>
  </div>

  <!--      
    Now that's the core element used by impress.js.
    
    That's the wrapper for your presentation steps. In this element all the impress.js magic happens.
    It doesn't have to be a `<div>`. Only `id` is important here as that's how the script find it.
    
    You probably won't need it now, but there are some configuration options that can be set on this element.
    
    To change the duration of the transition between slides use `data-transition-duration="2000"` giving it
    a number of ms. It defaults to 1000 (1s).
    
    You can also control the perspective with `data-perspective="500"` giving it a number of pixels.
    It defaults to 1000. You can set it to 0 if you don't want any 3D effects.
    If you are willing to change this value make sure you understand how CSS perspective works:
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/perspective
    
    But as I said, you won't need it for now, so don't worry - there are some simple but interesting things
    right around the corner of this tag ;)  
  -->
  <div id="impress">
    <!--        
      Here is where interesting thing start to happen.
      
      Each step of the presentation should be an element inside the `#impress` with a class name
      of `step`. These step elements are positioned, rotated and scaled by impress.js, and
      the 'camera' shows them on each step of the presentation.
      
      Positioning information is passed through data attributes.
      
      In the example below we only specify x and y position of the step element with `data-x="-1000"`
      and `data-y="-1500` attributes. This means that **the center** of the element (yes, the center)
      will be positioned in point x = -1000px and y = -1500px of the presentation 'canvas'.
      
      It will not be rotated or scaled.

  <!--
    Last, but not least.
    
    To make all described above really work, you need to include impress.js in the page.
    I strongly encourage to minify it first.
    
    In here I just include full source of the script to make it more readable.
    
    You also need to call a `impress().init()` function to initialize impress.js presentation.
    And you should do it in the end of your document. Not only because it's a good practice, but also
    because it should be done when the whole document is ready.
    Of course you can wrap it in any kind of "DOM ready" event, but I was too lazy to do so ;)
